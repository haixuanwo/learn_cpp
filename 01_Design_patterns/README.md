#### Creational Patterns
- [Abstract Factory], families of product objects
- [Builder], how a composite object gets created
- [Factory Method], subclass of object that is instantiated
- [Prototype], class of object that is instantiated
- [Singleton], the sole instance of a class
#### Structural Patterns
- [Adapter], interface to an object
- [Bridge], implementation of an object
- [Composite], structure and composition of an object
- [Decorator], responsibilities of an object without subclassing
- [Façade], interface to a subsystem
- [Flyweight], storage costs of objects
- [Proxy], how an object is accessed (its location)
#### Behavioral Patterns
- [Chain of Responsibility], object that can fulfill a request
- [Command], when and how a request is fulfilled
- [Interpreter], grammar and interpretation of a language
- [Iterator], how an aggregate's elements are accessed
- [Mediator], how and which objects interact with each other
- [Memento], what private information is stored outside an object, and when
- [Observer], how the dependent objects stay up to date
- [State], states of an object
- [Strategy], an algorithm
- [Template Method], steps of an algorithm
- [Visitor], operations that can be applied to objects without changing their classes
